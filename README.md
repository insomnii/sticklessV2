personal project to make a stickless (hitbox) arcade stick. size limitation based on ender 3 bed size.

uses an Arduino Pro Micro, only intended to use on PC (plan on making another with a brooks board, with some other changes/tuning)

- type C board option 1 [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Treedix-Type-C-Breakout-Connector-Converter/dp/B096M2HQLK) (hit or miss from experience. its been a bit finicky, randomly disconnects and becomes unrecognizable.)

- Type C board option 2 [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/ANMBEST-Connector-Receptacle-Adapter-Support/dp/B09WCSF8FC) (ended up using this, hence the securing bracket in the cad model)




note. im self taught on the programming and CAD side. so stuff here might not meet standards that most others use.

mainly uploading here for reference, letting others see/pull from this as needed.
